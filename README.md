# ReduxAnticheat
wtf was this before

redux is your typical protocollib anticheat. it is what it is
it has 32 checks (not to flex or anything)

i dont know if this is lightweight or not or if the base is good since my cpu seems to be horrific
open source thing, you can use it if you give some sort of credit

spigot: [notyet]
